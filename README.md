## github.copilot.chat.search.semanticTextResults

```text
Last milestone, we introduced the ability to perform a semantic search using GitHub Copilot to get search results that are semantically relevant to your query. We have now improved the search results by sorting them by their relevance. Keyword matches from more relevant snippets are deemed more relevant overall.
